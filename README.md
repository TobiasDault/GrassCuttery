# GrassCuttery: Wasting Time, Efficiently.

---
Description:

Every wished you could waste time, but more efficiently? Want to relive trauma
from mowing the yard in the summer with wasps hanging near your house, but
without the physical sweat and tears associated with those painful blocked
memories?

We introduce to you GrassCuttery, a new idle clicker game that's designed to
help you waste time, efficiently. Written with Godot 3.x for Android and iOS,
you can now spend your time cutting virtual grass instead of other time-wasters
like scrolling Reddit, staring at the wall, or doing your job.

Stemming from a joke statement said among a group of students in a Software
Engineering class, GrassCuttery brings you only the finest ~~floral screams~~
smell of cut grass.
